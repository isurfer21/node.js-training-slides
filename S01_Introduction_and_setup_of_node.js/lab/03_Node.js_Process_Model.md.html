    <textarea id="source"># Node.js Process Model

Node.js processes user requests differently when compared to a traditional web server model.

--

Node.js runs in a single process and the application code runs in a single thread and thereby needs less resources than other platforms.

--

All the user requests to your web application will be handled by a single thread and all the I/O work or long running job is performed asynchronously for a particular request.

--

So, this single thread doesn't have to wait for the request to complete and is free to handle the next request.

---

## Node.js Process Model

When asynchronous I/O work completes then it processes the request further and sends the response.

--

An event loop is constantly watching for the events to be raised for an asynchronous job and executing callback function when the job completes.

--

Internally, Node.js uses libev for the event loop which in turn uses internal C++ thread pool to provide asynchronous I/O.

## Node.js Process Model

Node.js process model increases the performance and scalability with a few caveats.

--

Node.js is not fit for an application which performs CPU-intensive operations like image processing or other heavy computation work because it takes time to process a request and thereby blocks the single thread.

---

## Everything inside Node.js runs in a *single-thread*
There is, of course, the question of sharing a single thread between all clients requests, and it is a potential pitfall of writing Node.js applications.

--

Firstly, heavy computation could choke up Nodeâ€™s single thread and cause problems for all clients (more on this later) as incoming requests would be blocked until said computation was completed.

--

Secondly, developers need to be really careful not to allow an exception bubbling up to the core (topmost) Node.js event loop, which will cause the Node.js instance to terminate (effectively crashing the program).
