    <textarea id="source"># Processes

The process object is a global that provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process. 

As a global, it is always available to Node.js applications without using require(). 

It can also be explicitly accessed using require():
```js
const process = require('process');
```
---

## Process Events
The process object is an instance of EventEmitter.

- Event: 'beforeExit'
- Event: 'disconnect'
- Event: 'exit'
- Event: 'message'
- Event: 'multipleResolves'
- Event: 'rejectionHandled'
- Event: 'uncaughtException'
- Event: 'unhandledRejection'
- Event: 'warning'
- Signal Events

---

### Event: 'beforeExit'#
The 'beforeExit' event is emitted when Node.js empties its event loop and has no additional work to schedule. Normally, the Node.js process will exit when there is no work scheduled, but a listener registered on the 'beforeExit' event can make asynchronous calls, and thereby cause the Node.js process to continue.
--

The listener callback function is invoked with the value of process.exitCode passed as the only argument.
--

The 'beforeExit' event is not emitted for conditions causing explicit termination, such as calling process.exit() or uncaught exceptions.

--

The 'beforeExit' should not be used as an alternative to the 'exit' event unless the intention is to schedule additional work.

---

### Event: 'disconnect'
If the Node.js process is spawned with an IPC channel (see the Child Process and Cluster documentation), the 'disconnect' event will be emitted when the IPC channel is closed.

---

### Event: 'exit'
```
code <integer>
```
The 'exit' event is emitted when the Node.js process is about to exit as a result of either:
 - The process.exit() method being called explicitly;
 - The Node.js event loop no longer having any additional work to perform.

--

There is no way to prevent the exiting of the event loop at this point, and once all 'exit' listeners have finished running the Node.js process will terminate.

--

The listener callback function is invoked with the exit code specified either by the process.exitCode property, or the exitCode argument passed to the process.exit() method.
```js
process.on('exit', (code) => {
  console.log(`About to exit with code: ${code}`);
});
```
---

### Event: 'exit' ...

Listener functions must only perform synchronous operations. The Node.js process will exit immediately after calling the 'exit' event listeners causing any additional work still queued in the event loop to be abandoned. In the following example, for instance, the timeout will never occur:
```js
process.on('exit', (code) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('This will not run');
  }, 0);
});
```

---

### Event: 'message'
```
message <Object> | <boolean> | <number> | <string> | <null> 
a parsed JSON object or a serializable primitive value.

sendHandle <net.Server> | <net.Socket> 
a net.Server or net.Socket object, or undefined.
```
--

If the Node.js process is spawned with an IPC channel (see the Child Process and Cluster documentation), the 'message' event is emitted whenever a message sent by a parent process using childprocess.send() is received by the child process.

The message goes through serialization and parsing. The resulting message might not be the same as what is originally sent.

---

### Event: 'multipleResolves'
```
type <string> 
The resolution type. One of 'resolve' or 'reject'.

promise <Promise> 
The promise that resolved or rejected more than once.

value <any> 
The value with which the promise was either resolved or 
rejected after the original resolve.
```
--

The 'multipleResolves' event is emitted whenever a Promise has been either:

- Resolved more than once.
- Rejected more than once.
- Rejected after resolve.
- Resolved after reject.

This is useful for tracking potential errors in an application while using the Promise constructor, as multiple resolutions are silently swallowed. However, the occurrence of this event does not necessarily indicate an error. 

---

### Event: 'multipleResolves' ...

For example, Promise.race() can trigger a 'multipleResolves' event.
```js
process.on('multipleResolves', (type, promise, reason) => {
  console.error(type, promise, reason);
  setImmediate(() => process.exit(1));
});

async function main() {
  try {
    return await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      resolve('First call');
      resolve('Swallowed resolve');
      reject(new Error('Swallowed reject'));
    });
  } catch {
    throw new Error('Failed');
  }
}

main().then(console.log);
// resolve: Promise { 'First call' } 'Swallowed resolve'
// reject: Promise { 'First call' } Error: Swallowed reject
//     at Promise (*)
//     at new Promise (<anonymous>)
//     at main (*)
// First call
```
---

### Event: 'rejectionHandled'
```
promise <Promise> 
The late handled promise.
```
--

The 'rejectionHandled' event is emitted whenever a Promise has been rejected and an error handler was attached to it (using promise.catch(), for example) later than one turn of the Node.js event loop.

--

The Promise object would have previously been emitted in an 'unhandledRejection' event, but during the course of processing gained a rejection handler.

--

There is no notion of a top level for a Promise chain at which rejections can always be handled. Being inherently asynchronous in nature, a Promise rejection can be handled at a future point in time â€” possibly much later than the event loop turn it takes for the 'unhandledRejection' event to be emitted.

---

### Event: 'rejectionHandled' ...
Another way of stating this is that, unlike in synchronous code where there is an ever-growing list of unhandled exceptions, with Promises there can be a growing-and-shrinking list of unhandled rejections.

--

In synchronous code, the 'uncaughtException' event is emitted when the list of unhandled exceptions grows.

--

In asynchronous code, the 'unhandledRejection' event is emitted when the list of unhandled rejections grows, and the 'rejectionHandled' event is emitted when the list of unhandled rejections shrinks.

---

### Event: 'rejectionHandled' ...

```js
const unhandledRejections = new Map();
process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
  unhandledRejections.set(promise, reason);
});
process.on('rejectionHandled', (promise) => {
  unhandledRejections.delete(promise);
});
```
--

In this example, the unhandledRejections Map will grow and shrink over time, reflecting rejections that start unhandled and then become handled. It is possible to record such errors in an error log, either periodically (which is likely best for long-running application) or upon process exit (which is likely most convenient for scripts).

---

### Event: 'uncaughtException'
```
err <Error> 
The uncaught exception.

origin <string> 
Indicates if the exception originates from an unhandled 
rejection or from synchronous errors. Can either be 
'uncaughtException' or 'unhandledRejection'.
```
--

The 'uncaughtException' event is emitted when an uncaught JavaScript exception bubbles all the way back to the event loop. 

--

By default, Node.js handles such exceptions by printing the stack trace to stderr and exiting with code 1, overriding any previously set process.exitCode. 

Adding a handler for the 'uncaughtException' event overrides this default behavior. 

---

### Event: 'uncaughtException' ...
Alternatively, change the process.exitCode in the 'uncaughtException' handler which will result in the process exiting with the provided exit code. 

Otherwise, in the presence of such handler the process will exit with 0.
```js
process.on('uncaughtException', (err, origin) => {
  fs.writeSync(
    process.stderr.fd,
    `Caught exception: ${err}\n` +
    `Exception origin: ${origin}`
  );
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('This will still run.');
}, 500);

// Intentionally cause an exception, but don't catch it.
nonexistentFunc();
console.log('This will not run.');
```
---

### Event: 'unhandledRejection'
```
reason <Error> | <any> 
The object with which the promise was rejected 
(typically an Error object).

promise <Promise> 
The rejected promise.
```
--

The 'unhandledRejection' event is emitted whenever a Promise is rejected and no error handler is attached to the promise within a turn of the event loop. When programming with Promises, exceptions are encapsulated as "rejected promises". Rejections can be caught and handled using promise.catch() and are propagated through a Promise chain. The 'unhandledRejection' event is useful for detecting and keeping track of promises that were rejected whose rejections have not yet been handled.
```js
process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
  console.log('Unhandled Rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason);
  // Application specific logging, throwing an error, or other logic here
});

somePromise.then((res) => {
  return reportToUser(JSON.pasre(res)); // Note the typo ('pasre')
}); // No '.catch()' or '.then()'
```
---

### Event: 'unhandledRejection' ...
The following will also trigger the 'unhandledRejection' event to be emitted:
```js
function SomeResource() {
  // Initially set the loaded status to a rejected promise
  this.loaded = Promise.reject(new Error('Resource not yet loaded!'));
}

const resource = new SomeResource();
// no .catch or .then on resource.loaded for at least a turn
```

In this example case, it is possible to track the rejection as a developer error as would typically be the case for other 'unhandledRejection' events. To address such failures, a non-operational .catch(() => { }) handler may be attached to resource.loaded, which would prevent the 'unhandledRejection' event from being emitted.

---

### Event: 'warning'
```
warning <Error> 
Key properties of the warning are:

name <string> 
The name of the warning. Default: 'Warning'.

message <string> 
A system-provided description of the warning.

stack <string> 
A stack trace to the location in the code 
where the warning was issued.
```
The 'warning' event is emitted whenever Node.js emits a process warning.

---

### Event: 'warning' ...

A process warning is similar to an error in that it describes exceptional conditions that are being brought to the user's attention. However, warnings are not part of the normal Node.js and JavaScript error handling flow. Node.js can emit warnings whenever it detects bad coding practices that could lead to sub-optimal application performance, bugs, or security vulnerabilities.
```js
process.on('warning', (warning) => {
  console.warn(warning.name);    // Print the warning name
  console.warn(warning.message); // Print the warning message
  console.warn(warning.stack);   // Print the stack trace
});
```
---

### Event: 'warning' ...

By default, Node.js will print process warnings to stderr. The --no-warnings command-line option can be used to suppress the default console output but the 'warning' event will still be emitted by the process object.

The following example illustrates the warning that is printed to stderr when too many listeners have been added to an event:
```shell
$ node
> events.defaultMaxListeners = 1;
> process.on('foo', () => {});
> process.on('foo', () => {});
> (node:38638) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak
detected. 2 foo listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit
```
---

### Event: 'warning' ...

In contrast, the following example turns off the default warning output and adds a custom handler to the 'warning' event:
```shell
$ node --no-warnings
> const p = process.on('warning', (warning) => console.warn('Do not do that!'));
> events.defaultMaxListeners = 1;
> process.on('foo', () => {});
> process.on('foo', () => {});
> Do not do that!
```
---

### Event: 'warning' ...

The --trace-warnings command-line option can be used to have the default console output for warnings include the full stack trace of the warning.

Launching Node.js using the --throw-deprecation command line flag will cause custom deprecation warnings to be thrown as exceptions.

Using the --trace-deprecation command line flag will cause the custom deprecation to be printed to stderr along with the stack trace.

Using the --no-deprecation command line flag will suppress all reporting of the custom deprecation.

The *-deprecation command line flags only affect warnings that use the name 'DeprecationWarning'.

---

### Signal Events
Signal events will be emitted when the Node.js process receives a signal. Please refer to signal(7) for a listing of standard POSIX signal names such as 'SIGINT', 'SIGHUP', etc.

The signal handler will receive the signal's name ('SIGINT', 'SIGTERM', etc.) as the first argument.

The name of each event will be the uppercase common name for the signal (e.g. 'SIGINT' for SIGINT signals).
```js
// Begin reading from stdin so the process does not exit.
process.stdin.resume();

process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  console.log('Received SIGINT. Press Control-D to exit.');
});

// Using a single function to handle multiple signals
function handle(signal) {
  console.log(`Received ${signal}`);
}

process.on('SIGINT', handle);
process.on('SIGTERM', handle);
```
---

## process.abort()
The process.abort() method causes the Node.js process to exit immediately and generate a core file.

This feature is not available in Worker threads.

---

## process.arch
```
<string>
```
--

The process.arch property returns a string identifying the operating system CPU architecture for which the Node.js binary was compiled.

The current possible values are: 'arm', 'arm64', 'ia32', 'mips', 'mipsel', 'ppc', 'ppc64', 's390', 's390x', 'x32', and 'x64'.
```js
console.log(`This processor architecture is ${process.arch}`);
```
---

### process.cwd()
```
Returns: <string>
```
--

The process.cwd() method returns the current working directory of the Node.js process.
```js
console.log(`Current directory: ${process.cwd()}`);
```
---

## process.argv
```
<string[]>
```
--

The process.argv property returns an array containing the command line arguments passed when the Node.js process was launched. 

The first element will be process.execPath. 

See `process.argv0` if access to the original value of argv[0] is needed. 

The second element will be the path to the JavaScript file being executed. 

The remaining elements will be any additional command line arguments.

---

## process.argv ...

For example, assuming the following script for process-args.js:
```js
// print process.argv
process.argv.forEach((val, index) => {
  console.log(`${index}: ${val}`);
});
```
Launching the Node.js process as:
```shell
$ node process-args.js one two=three four
```
Would generate the output:
```shell
0: /usr/local/bin/node
1: /Users/mjr/work/node/process-args.js
2: one
3: two=three
4: four
```
---

## process.argv0
```
<string>
```
--

The process.argv0 property stores a read-only copy of the original value of argv[0] passed when Node.js starts.
```shell
$ bash -c 'exec -a customArgv0 ./node'
> process.argv[0]
'/Volumes/code/external/node/out/Release/node'
> process.argv0
'customArgv0'
```
