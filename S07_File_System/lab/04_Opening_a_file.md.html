    <textarea id="source"># Opening a file

--

## Using open()
The open() method opens a file by passing a file name to the method (or path string), along with how to open the file using a flag as the second parameter.

---
## Example
```js
var fs = require("fs");
var path = "c:\\Temp\\Test.txt";

fs.open(path, "w+", function(error, fd) {
  if (error) {
    console.error("open error:  " + error.message);
  } else {
    console.log("Successfully opened " + path);
  }
});
```

---

### r
Open for reading. An exception occurs if the file does not exist.

### r+
Open for reading and writing. An exception occurs if the file does not exist.

### rs
Open for reading in synchronous mode, which instructs the operating system to bypass the system cache. This is mostly used for opening files on NFS mounts; it does not make open() a synchronous method.

### rs+
Open for reading and writing in synchronous mode.

---

### w
Open for writing. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file already exists, it is truncated.

### wx
Similar to the w flag, but the file is opened in exclusive mode. Exclusive mode ensures that the files are newly created.

### w+
Open for reading and writing. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file already exists, it is truncated.

### wx+
Similar to the w+ flag, but the file is opened in exclusive mode.

---

### a
Open for appending. If the file does not exist, it is created.

### ax
Similar to the a flag, but the file is opened in exclusive mode.

### a+
Open for reading and appending. If the file does not exist, it is created.

### ax+
Similar to the a+ flag, but the file is opened in exclusive mode.
